# es6-wallaby-kata
es6 katas based on great work at http://tddbin.com, but flatten, ordered, and made to work with wallabyjs

Clone, configure your IDE to run wallaby using the provided wallaby.js file. Because of (intentional) syntax error in the tests, after starting up wallaby, you will have to open a file you want to work with, and make a change, so wallabyjs reloads just that file and provide you the coverage. For example - add enter anywhere, and start hacking till that file is all green, then move to the next one, and repeat.

Good luck!
